# PLC Maintenance Portal: UI/UX Expert Review & Recommendations

#### **Executive Summary**

The portal provides a solid foundation for essential maintenance tasks. Its strength lies in consolidating fault logs, I/O control, and trend data into a single web-based interface accessible on multiple devices. However, the current design presents significant opportunities for improvement, particularly in high-stress, time-critical situations. The most critical issues identified are:

1.  **High Cognitive Load During Fault Investigation:** The path from alarm to root cause is not as direct as it could be, potentially slowing down diagnostics.
2.  **Risk of Human Error in Manual Operations:** The "force" function, while necessary, may lack sufficient safeguards, increasing the risk of accidental and potentially unsafe actions.
3.  **Suboptimal Data Visualization:** Key information, especially on trend displays and mobile views, may lack the clarity required for rapid, at-a-glance interpretation.

This report outlines a series of prioritized recommendations focused on enhancing situational awareness, reducing the risk of operator error, and streamlining core maintenance workflows for both novice and expert technicians.

#### **Scenario-based Analysis**

##### **Scenario 1: Fault Investigation**
*A technician gets an alarm notification. The goal is to move from notification to identifying the root cause in the PLC fault log quickly and efficiently.*

**Findings:**
*   **Alarm Ambiguity:** Alarm notifications (e.g., a red banner or icon) often lack context. The user must navigate to a separate screen to understand the alarm's origin, severity, and status, losing valuable seconds.
*   **Inefficient Navigation:** The flow from a global alarm indicator to the specific PLC's fault log likely requires multiple clicks (e.g., Dashboard -> Area -> PLC -> Fault Log), increasing cognitive load.
*   **Non-Actionable Data:** Fault logs are often presented as raw, timestamped data from the PLC. Without human-readable descriptions, filtering, or sorting capabilities, technicians must manually parse a dense list to find the relevant information, especially during a fault cascade.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Implement Actionable Alarm Banners:**
    *   Any alarm notification (especially a persistent header) should be clickable.
    *   Clicking the banner should take the user *directly* to the fault log of the specific PLC that is in an alarm state, pre-filtered to show the active, unacknowledged alarm.
*   **Enrich Fault Log Data:**
    *   Translate PLC fault codes into clear, human-readable descriptions within the UI. Store this mapping in a central database.
    *   Clearly distinguish between active, unacknowledged, and historical faults using both color and iconography (e.g., flashing red for new, solid red for acknowledged, gray for historical). This aligns with the ISA 18.2 alarm management standard.
*   **Introduce Smart Filtering:**
    *   Provide powerful filtering and sorting options for the fault log: by date/time range, severity, alarm status, and free-text search on the description. This is crucial for isolating issues on complex systems.

##### **Scenario 2: Forcing a Bit**
*A technician needs to force a specific input or output to troubleshoot a circuit. The interaction must be clear, safe, and deliberate.*

**Findings:**
*   **High Risk of Mis-clicks:** On a tablet, buttons for "Force" and "Cancel," or adjacent I/O points, can be too close together, leading to accidental activation of the wrong command.
*   **Lack of Persistent Feedback:** Once a bit is forced, the visual indication may not be prominent enough. A user could navigate away and forget the force is active, leading to unsafe conditions or confusing system behavior later.
*   **Insufficient Confirmation:** A single-click force operation is inherently risky. It doesn't give the user a moment to pause and confirm their action is correct.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Implement a Two-Step Confirmation Dialog:**
    *   Upon clicking "Force," a modal dialog should appear stating exactly what is about to happen (e.g., "You are about to FORCE Input `I:1/0` to `ON`").
    *   This dialog must have clearly labeled, well-spaced "Confirm" and "Cancel" buttons. The "Confirm" button should initially be disabled for 1-2 seconds to ensure the user reads the prompt.
*   **Provide System-Wide, Persistent "Forced" Status:**
    *   Any I/O point that is forced must have a highly visible and distinct visual state (e.g., a bright yellow border, a "forced" icon `!`).
    *   A persistent banner should appear at the top of the entire application (e.g., "WARNING: 3 I/O points are currently forced on PLC-5") as long as any force is active. This banner should be a link to a screen summarizing all active forces.
*   **Introduce Temporary Forces & RBAC:**
    *   Consider adding an option for a "Temporary Force" that automatically clears after a user-defined period (e.g., 15 minutes).
    *   Restrict the ability to force I/O to senior technicians or engineers using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

##### **Scenario 3: Performance Monitoring**
*A technician needs to view trend data for a particular analog input over the last 24 hours. The focus is on readability and ease of use.*

**Findings:**
*   **Inefficient Trend Access:** Accessing a trend for a specific point often requires navigating to a dedicated "Trending" page and manually configuring the pens, rather than accessing it contextually.
*   **Poor Mobile Readability:** Complex charts with multiple pens, small fonts, and fine lines can be nearly impossible to interpret on a tablet, especially in non-ideal lighting. Pinch-to-zoom gestures may be clunky or unsupported.
*   **Clunky Time-Range Selection:** Custom time-range pickers are often difficult to use on mobile devices. Key, common look-back periods may be missing.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Enable Contextual "Quick Trends":**
    *   From any I/O display screen, allow the user to click an icon next to an analog value to immediately open a pop-up trend chart for that single point, pre-configured for a default time range (e.g., "Last 60 Minutes").
*   **Optimize Trend Visualization:**
    *   **Desktop:** On hover, display a tooltip with the exact value and timestamp for all pens at the cursor's position.
    *   **Mobile:** Use a "tap-and-drag" crosshair to show values. Ensure lines have sufficient weight and contrast. Provide a legend that can be toggled on/off to reduce clutter.
*   **Simplify Time Selection:**
    *   Provide pre-set buttons for the most common time ranges: "Last 1 Hr," "Last 8 Hrs," "Last 24 Hrs," "Last 7 Days."
    *   Keep the custom date/time range picker available but make the presets the primary, most accessible method of time selection.

#### **General Heuristic Findings**

*   **Visual Consistency:** The use of colors, icons, and terminology should be standardized across all views. For example, the color for "ON" or "Active" should be consistent everywhere. An audit should be performed to create a unified design system.
*   **Contrast and Legibility:** The entire interface should be tested for high contrast (WCAG AA minimum) to be legible in both dark control rooms and bright, sunlit areas of the plant. Font sizes, especially on data-dense tables, should be configurable or default to a larger, more readable size.
*   **Feedback on Action:** Every user action (a button click, a data entry) must provide immediate and clear feedback, such as a loading spinner, a success message ("Toast"), or a validation error. This prevents duplicate actions and confirms to the user that the system is responding.
*   **Responsive Design:** Elements must reflow intelligently on smaller screens. Data tables on mobile should collapse into a list view rather than requiring horizontal scrolling. All buttons and interactive elements must have a minimum tap target size of 44x44 pixels to be easily used on a tablet.
