How to Design APIs Like a Senior Engineer: A Detailed Synopsis
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of API design, covering the essential skills and best practices that distinguish senior engineers.

Four Fundamental Principles of API Design
To create efficient, scalable, and maintainable APIs, it is crucial to adhere to four fundamental principles:

Consistency: APIs should maintain consistency in naming conventions, casing, and patterns across all endpoints.

Simplicity: APIs should be designed to be straightforward, focusing on core functionalities and an intuitive user experience.

Security: It is imperative to incorporate robust security measures, including authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting.

Performance: APIs should be optimized for efficiency through proper caching strategies, pagination for large datasets, and minimizing payload sizes.

API Styles: REST, GraphQL, and gRPC
The video explores three primary API styles, each with its unique characteristics and use cases:

REST (Representational State Transfer)
Characteristics:

Utilizes a resource-based approach with standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE).

Stateless, with each request containing all necessary information.

Features resource-based endpoints (e.g., /users, /posts).

Employs explicit versioning (e.g., v1, v2).

Use Cases:

Widely used in web and mobile applications.

GraphQL
Characteristics:

A query language that allows clients to request precisely the data they need.

Utilizes a single endpoint for all operations (e.g., /graphql).

Operations are categorized as queries, mutations, or subscriptions.

The schema can evolve without explicit versioning.

Use Cases:

Ideal for complex user interfaces where data requirements are varied and deeply nested.

gRPC
Characteristics:

A high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.

Utilizes protocol buffers for communication.

Supports streaming and bidirectional communication.

Employs HTTP/2 for transport.

Use Cases:

Well-suited for microservices and internal system communication.

Best Practices for RESTful API Design
Use Plural Nouns for Resources: Resource collections in URLs should always be plural (e.g., /products).

Proper HTTP Methods: Utilize the correct HTTP methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Support for Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination: Implement capabilities for filtering, sorting, and pagination to enhance performance and reduce bandwidth usage.

API Versioning: Include versioning in the API URL (e.g., /api/v1/products) to ensure backward compatibility.

Best Practices for GraphQL API Design
Keep Schemas Small and Modular: Maintain small and modular schemas to improve manageability.

Avoid Deeply Nested Queries: Implement query depth limits to prevent overly complex and resource-intensive requests.

Use Meaningful Naming: Employ descriptive names for types and fields to enhance clarity.

Use Input Types for Mutations: When modifying data, always use input types for mutations.

Authentication Best Practices
Bearer Tokens: Use bearer tokens as the standard for their speed and stateless nature.

OAuth 2.0: Employ OAuth 2.0 for authentication through trusted providers like Google or GitHub.

JWTs (JSON Web Tokens): Utilize JWTs for stateless authentication, allowing each request to be processed independently.

Access and Refresh Tokens: Implement a system of short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens to enhance security and user experience.

Single Sign-On (SSO): Leverage SSO with identity protocols like SAML or OAuth 2.0 to allow users to access multiple services with a single login.

Authorization Best Practices
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assign users to roles with predefined sets of permissions.

Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Use a combination of user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental conditions to define access.

Access Control Lists (ACL): Assign explicit permissions to individual resources for fine-grained control.

Enforcing Authorization with OAuth 2.0 and JWTs: Use OAuth 2.0 for delegated authorization and JWTs to carry user identity and claims.

API Security Best Practices
Rate Limiting: Control the number of requests a client can make to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): Control which domains can access your API from a browser.

Prevent SQL and NoSQL Injections: Use parameterized queries or ORM safeguards to prevent malicious code injection.

Firewalls: Use web application firewalls to filter malicious traffic.

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks): Use VPNs for private APIs that should only be accessible from specific networks.

Prevent CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Use CSRF tokens to verify the legitimacy of requests.

Prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.
